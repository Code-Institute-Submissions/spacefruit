## Introduction

Welcome to Spacefruit, the extraordinary (fictional) creative agency that brings your wildest branding, design, and animation dreams to life! My purpose in designing this website is to make a lasting positive impression on visitors and establish trust with them, in order to attract new potential clients to the business. The website is designed as a Single Landing page, allowing the viewer to progress through the content in an uninterrupted flow and enabling the story of the brand to unfold.

While researching other creative agencies, I noticed they place a high emphasis on the aesthetic appeal of their websites to catch the attention of new clients. Therefore, I chose to create a project centering around a fictional creative agency of my own imagination. This decision allowed me to challenge myself in creating a bold, striking, and cohesive visual design, providing what I believe is an excellent showcase of my frontend web development skills.

## User Experience (UX)

- ### User stories

  - #### User Goals

    The term "user" refers to individuals, potentially including prospective clients, who could be exploring the website for their first time.

    1. As a user, I want to easily understand the services offered by the agency.
    2. As a user, I want to navigate easily and find the content I'm looking for regardless of where I am on the page.
    3. As a user, I want to see compelling examples of any previous campaigns the agency has worked on.
    4. As a user, I want to determine if the agency has collaborated with any notable brands before.
    5. As a user, I want to find client testimonials to gain insights into what their users think of them and assess their level of trustworthiness.
    6. As a user, I want to have a user-friendly way to message the agency and find their contact details, along with any social media links.

  - #### Company Goals

    The company also has its own objectives and goals associated with the website.

    1. As a company, I want to make a positive impression on any potential clients in an effort to attract new business.
    2. As a company, I want to showcase our best work to prove our capability and skill in delivering to potential clients.
    3. As a company, I want to ensure the content and information presented on the site is relevant to serving the needs of the visitor.
    4. As a company, I want a strong CTA (Call to Action) to establish communication and build relationships with new clients.

## Design

- #### Colour Scheme
  ### <img src="assets/images/readme/design/colour-scheme.webp">
  I have chosen a nice shade of golden yellow as the primary color of the brand and complemented it with a punchy pink to serve as the accent color. I have also subtly altered the black and white colors from their maximum values, providing a more subtle contrast for a smoother reading experience.
- #### Typography
  ### <img src="assets/images/readme/design/typography.webp">
  I've opted for Montserrat as the main font for the website, paired with Source Sans as the body text. This combination works well together, providing a clean and attractive style. In case of any importing issues, the default sans-serif on the users browser serves as a reliable fallback font. The result is a polished and cohesive design that enhances the overall aesthetics and readability of the site.
- #### Components
  ### <img src="assets/images/readme/design/components.webp">
  By adopting a component-centric approach in my UI design, I designed and created reusable UI components that serve multiple purposes. This approach guarantees a consistent and harmonious look and feel across the entire user interface, elevating the overall user experience when navigating my site.
- #### Imagery

  Imagery is crucial to the aesthetic appeal of the design. I aimed to ensure a sense of continuity throughout the entire design by using imagery that adhered to the color palette of the project. My intention was to convey a retro and playful yet professional vibe, making the visuals as eye-catching as possible.

- #### Wireframes

  I created the initial website wireframes in Figma, allowing me to iterate on the design and experiment with imagery, typography, color, and layout. This was all then codified into a design system to ensure consistency in my design elements. Once I was satisfied with the UI/UX design and content placement, I proceeded to the coding stage of the project.

## Features

### Existing Features

<h3 align="center"> Navigation Bar</h3>

### <img src="assets/images/readme/features/navbar-desktop.webp" alt="Desktop version of the navigation bar">

- The navigation bar features links that enable users to smoothly scroll to any of the main page sections.

- At the top of the page, the navbar maintains a transparent background in order to avoid interfering with the visuals of the hero image, while still remaining clearly visible.

### <img src="assets/images/readme/features/navbar-sticky.webp" alt="Sticky desktop navigation bar">

- As the user scrolls past the hero section of the page, the navbar becomes sticky and affixes to the top of the viewport. It changes to the primary background color to distinguish it from the page's content.

- A fixed navigation bar allows users to navigate through the page seamlessly, regardless of their position on the website. This is particularly crucial for single-page apps with considerable vertical dimensions, as it helps minimize unnecessary scrolling.

### <img src="assets/images/readme/features/navbar-mobile.webp" alt="Collapsed navigation for mobile">

- On smaller screen widths, the navbar menu collapses into a single hamburger icon. This approach prevents the links from becoming too crowded together.

### <div align="center"><img src="assets/images/readme/features/navbar-mobile-menu.webp" alt="Expanded mobile navigation menu" height="500px"></div>

- Clicking the hamburger icon for the mobile version of the navbar reveals an overlay menu. This design provides more space between the links, allowing users to easily click on each link to be directed to the corresponding section of the page.

---

<br />

<h3 align="center">Hero Section</h3>

### <img src="assets/images/readme/features/hero-section.webp" alt="Website hero section">

- The Hero Section of a website occupies the full width of the screen and is located at the top of the page, above the fold (i.e., the portion of the webpage visible without scrolling). Given its prime location, I wanted it to capture the visitor's attention and prompt them to engage further with the content or offerings of the website.

- I also ensured to position the imagery in a way that would look good across a range of different devices, from desktops to mobiles.

<br />

---

<br />

<h3 align="center">Services Section</h3>

### <img src="assets/images/readme/features/services-section.webp" alt="Services section with individual cards">

- The Services Section distinctly highlights each offering of the agency. Every service is presented in its own card, ensuring clarity. To ensure responsiveness, the cards adjust into columns as the viewport narrows.

<br />

---

<br />

<h3 align="center">Portfolio Section</h3>

### <img src="assets/images/readme/features/portfolio-section.webp" alt="Overview of portfolio section">

- The Portfolio Section showcases the company's recent campaigns. Each entry features a visual, accompanied by a summary describing the campaign's focus.

### <div align="center"><img src="assets/images/readme/features/portfolio-card.webp" height="500px" alt="Detailed view of a portfolio card on mobile"></div>

- Each card adapts to position the image above the text, ensuring a pleasant and readable experience on smaller mobile devices.

<br />

---

<br />

<h3 align="center">Clients Section</h3>

### <img src="assets/images/readme/features/clients-section.webp" alt="Section showcasing client logos">

- The Clients Section showcases the agency's collaboration with recognizable and reputable companies, thereby bolstering its credibility and instilling confidence in potential clients. Since logos are inherently recognizable, additional text is minimized to ensure a clean design.

<br />

---

<br />

### <h3 align="center">Testimonials Section</h3>

### <img src="assets/images/readme/features/testimonials-section.webp" alt="Testimonials from clients">

- Similar to the Clients Section, the Testimonials Section is designed to bolster trust in the agency. I implemented interactivity in this section using JavaScript, enabling users to cycle through testimonials via pagination controls at the bottom. I believe this approach offers a more streamlined and efficient way to present the information.

<br />

---

<br />

<h3 align="center">Team Section</h3>

### <img src="assets/images/readme/features/team-section.webp" alt="Grid view of team members">

- The team section is arranged in a 3x3 grid format on larger screens, collapsing to accommodate smaller ones. Each team member is featured in a full frontal profile shot, accompanied by a brief description of their role in the company.

<br />

---

<br />

<h3 align="center">Call To Action Section</h3>

### <img src="assets/images/readme/features/cta-section.webp" alt="Website's call to action section">

- The Call-To-Action Section includes a full-screen background, echoing the style of the Hero Section, and offers a fitting wrap-up for the website. With eye-catching visuals and a standout CTA button front and center, it encourages users to get in touch after getting a taste of what the agency can do.

<br />

---

<br />

<h3 align="center">Footer Section</h3>

### <img src="assets/images/readme/features/footer-section.webp" alt="Website footer with social links">

- The Footer Section displays the logo, legal information, and a list of links directing users to respective social media pages. I've consolidated all social links in one spot and placed them here, as its conventional to see them in the footer of many other websites.

<br />

---

<br />

<h3 align="center">Contact Form Modal</h3>

### <img src="assets/images/readme/features/modal-desktop.webp" alt="Desktop view of the contact form modal">

- The Contact Form was implemented inside of a modal component so that it could appear over the main content. This focuses the user's attention solely on the form, reducing distractions from other elements on the page. It also helps save webpage space, leading to a cleaner design.

### <img src="assets/images/readme/features/modal-completed.webp" alt="Animation after successful form submission">

- After submitting the form, it's essential for users to receive immediate feedback. To address this, a subtle welcome animation appears, signaling a successful submission and reassuring them that they'll be contacted soon.

### <div align="center"> <img src="assets/images/readme/features/modal-mobile.webp" height="500px" alt="Mobile version of the contact form modal"></div>

- On mobile devices, placement of the image switches to the top to give the inputs the necessary space, ensuring users can comfortably fill out the form.

---

<br />

<h3 align="center">404 Page</h3>

### <img src="assets/images/readme/features/404-page.webp" alt="Custom 404 error page">

- The 404 Page sports a full-screen background in line with the site's branding, reassuring users they're still on the same website. With a notification that the page is missing and a brief explanation, a button allows them to be redirected back to the homepage for a more seamless user experience.

<br />

---

<br />

### Future Implementations

1. **Expanding the website's portfolio section**

   - Offer more detailed insights into each showcased campaign by adding a "Learn More" button at the bottom of each card.
   - Link these buttons to dedicated pages that provide comprehensive information about the campaigns.
   - Incorporate multimedia content, such as videos, photos, and graphics, to provide a richer user experience. This will allow visitors to immerse themselves in the campaigns' stories and details.

   <br />

2. **Dark theme**

   - Implement a dark theme mode for the website that users can toggle.
   - This will be beneficial for users who prefer darker aesthetics or for those browsing at night, reducing eye strain.
   - Ensure that the dark theme maintains the website's overall design coherence and doesn‚Äôt affect the user experience negatively.

   <br />

### Accessibility

**Semantic Tags** - The HTML is structured using semantic tags which help give meaning to the content and improve the user experience for those using screen readers.

**Readable Sans-Serif Font** - I chose a sans-serif font for the body text of the site because they are more suitable for people with dyslexia, aiding in content readability.

**Responsive Typography** - I made sure to set my font sizes using REM units, which scale relative to the base font size set by the browser. These units help ensure that users who require larger text for better readability, such as those with visual impairments, can easily adjust the font size without breaking the layout.

**Disable Animations** - I've implemented a CSS code segment using the prefers-reduced-motion media query. This ensures animations are turned off for users who prefer reduced motion, allowing for a more accessible and user-friendly experience, especially for those sensitive to excessive animations.

- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
- [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)
- [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)

### Applications, Plugins & Tools Used

1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - I used Visual Studio Code on my local machine as my preferred IDE for coding the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It assisted in the development process of the project and in creating the README file using markdown.

2. [Figma](https://figma.com/) - I employed Figma to craft the high-fidelity UI mockups during the UI/UX design planning phase. It also served to plan the website's design system and to organize UI elements into modular, reusable components. This facilitated a more structured approach to my CSS coding in later stages.

3. [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/) - I utilized Midjourney to generate all the website images. By incorporating specific keywords, I ensured that the images were produced in a consistent art style for a cohesive visual design. With my paid account plan, I have the right to use these generated images for my project, in line with Midjourney's [terms of service](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/terms-of-service).

4. [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/ie/products/photoshop.html) - Photoshop was instrumental in editing and cleaning up images from Midjourney. Furthermore, it enabled the compression and optimization of image file sizes to make them web-friendly, thus enhancing the website's loading performance.

5. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - I used Git for version control, operating it from the terminal on my local machine. All modifications were pushed to my remote repository on GitHub.

6. [GitHub](https://github.com/) - GitHub hosts my project remotely, making the source code accessible to others. I also use it to deploy my site via GitHub Pages.

7. [Am I Responsive?](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) - This tool displays the website image across various devices.

8. [Shields.io](https://shields.io/) - I used this to integrate badges into the README.

9. [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Google Fonts was employed to import both 'Montserrat' and 'Source Sans' fonts into the CSS stylesheet.

10. [Thin Glyphs Icon Set](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1003754713433918928) - I incorporated this Figma Icon Set for the website's decorative icons.

11. [Retturoo: Hand Drawn Retro Shapes](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1163470945933586849) - I selected shapes from this Figma collection for the website's decorative elements.

12. [Brandfetch Figma Plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/733590967040604714/Brandfetch) - This plugin in Figma facilitated the creation of SVG logos for both the brand section of the website and the social media logos in the footer.

13. [User Profile Figma Plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/749945157855564842/User-Profile) - This plugin in Figma enabled me to generate image profile avatars for each persona in the testimonial section.

14. [Tiny Img](https://tiny-img.com/webp/) - I used this platform to compress my images to a more optimal file size for the web, and also to convert them to the contemporary .webp format.

15. [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - This tool played a role in inspiring some of the website's text content and was invaluable in checking for spelling or grammatical inaccuracies in the text. It also offered helpful suggestions for ways I could improve the code I wrote, particularly in the areas of accessibility and coming up with good semantic class names.

## Testing

### Automated Testing

#### Validator Testing

- #### HTML

  ### <img src="assets/images/readme/testing/html-validation-result.webp" alt="Final result of the W3C Markup Validation Service" width="400">

  [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fshanedoyledev.github.io%2Fspacefruit%2F) - On initial submission I recieved error messages indicating that 'px' values should not be suffixed to the width and height attributes of images. After removing the 'px' suffixes, the validation passed without any errors.

- #### CSS

  ### <img src="assets/images/readme/testing/css-validation-result.webp" alt="Final result of the igsaw CSS Validation Service" width="400">

  [W3C Jigsaw CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fshanedoyledev.github.io%2Fspacefruit%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en) - No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator.

<br/>

- #### LightHouse

  Lighthouse was used within Chrome Developer Tools to test the performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO of the website.

  #### Desktop

  This is my initial Lighthouse ranking for the desktop version.

  ### <img src="assets/images/readme/testing//lighthouse-initial-score-desktop.webp" alt="initial desktop score on lighthouse">

  #### Mobile

  This is my initial Lighthouse ranking for the mobile version.

  ### <img src="assets/images/readme/testing//lighthouse-initial-score-mobile.webp" alt="initial mobile score on lighthouse">

  #### Improvements

  I was satisfied with my performance rating but wanted to investigate further what was causing the lower scores for both the best practices and SEO rating.

  - SEO - Lighthouse informed me that I was missing meta tags in the `<head>` of my HTML document. Therefore, I went ahead and included them. These meta tags included the description and keyword tags, respectively.

  - Best Practices - I received feedback that some of my images did not have a clearly defined width and height. Therefore, I made sure to set them in my CSS stylesheet.

  #### Final Score

  - I was delighted to see that when I addressed these issues, I was able to push my ranking to a perfect score!

### <div align="center"><img src="assets/images/readme/testing/lighthouse-final-score.gif" alt="a GIF showing the final lighthouse score"></div>

<br/>

- #### Accessibility

  - [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://shanedoyledev.github.io/spacefruit/) - When first analyzing my website with the Wave tool, I encountered no errors. However, there were some aspects highlighted that I have since addressed and detailed below.

    <img src="assets/images/readme/testing/low-contrast-score.webp" width="300">

    <br/>

  - There was low contrast on the text of three of the subheadings on each of the campaign cards in the portfolio section. I changed the text color from white to black to help them stand out more prominently and improve the contrast for better readability.

    <img src="assets/images/readme/testing/alt-text-alerts.webp" width="300">

    <br/>

  - I was advised to improve the 'alt' descriptions for several images, as repetitive text was used across multiple images in the testimonial and team sections of the website. I've since revised them to be both unique and more descriptive.

  - Wave notified me that the images on my website lacked aria-labels. As these are important for accessibility, I took the initiative to revisit and update the HTML code. By adding these labels, this ensures a more user-friendly experience, especially for those using assistive technologies.

  - Here is the final Wave report after addressing all of these issues.

### Bugs

### Known Bugs

1. **Missing Images on Deployment**

   ### <img src="assets/images/readme/testing/missing-image-links.webp" alt="Screenshot showing missing images after deploying to GitHub pages]">

After deploying my website to Github pages, I noticed that some of my images weren't displayed, even though they appeared correctly on my local machine.

</br>

2. **Flashing Animations on Window Resize**

<div align="center"><img src="assets/images/readme/testing/flashing-animation-resize.gif" alt="GIF demonstrating elements flashing and jumping around when the browser window is resized"></div>

<br/>

Resizing the browser window caused certain elements on the webpage, like the navbar, to flash and jump around.

---

### Solved Bugs

1. **Missing images on deployment (Solved)**

   ### <img src="assets/images/readme/testing/image-link-path.webp" alt="Chrome developer tools highlighting the incorrect image link path">

Upon inspecting my image links, I noticed that a few began with a "/" making them absolute links. Removing the forward slash converted them into relative links, allowing the images to be displayed correctly when the site was deployed.

<br/>

2. **Flashing animations on window resize (Solved)**

<div align="center"><img src="assets/images/readme/testing/flashing-animation-resize-solved.gif" alt="GIF showing the resolved flashing animations when resizing the browser window"></div>

<br/>

After researching the issue, I discovered that the problem was caused by media queries altering the properties of certain elements at specific breakpoints. The transition property caused these changes to be animated, leading to the flashing and erratic movement on screen.

I resolved this by referencing an [article from CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/stop-animations-during-window-resizing/) which addresses this issue. The article recommended using JavaScript to temporarily disable transition animations during a window resize event, effectively fixing the problem.

## Credits

### Code Used And Tutorials

- [Create a Design System with CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRaL-8qZ0mM&t=3178s) - This course by Kevin Powell introduced the "reduced motion" CSS snippet. It not only enhanced my website's accessibility but also influenced the planning of my website's design system.

- [CSS Tricks: Stop Animations During Window Resizing](https://css-tricks.com/stop-animations-during-window-resizing/) - I utilized the JavaScript code snippet from this article to temporarily halt transition animations while resizing the window. This was crucial in resolving a glitch where elements would sporadically flash and shift during viewport resizing.

- [Build and deploy a portfolio website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xkSvufmjEs) - Some of the code for the interactive mobile navigation used on this website was taken from a portfolio website tutorial by Kevin Powell. It was then readapted and customized for my own project.

- [Jonas Schmedtmann's Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) - The chapter on DOM manipulation from this excellent course gave me the knowledge needed to impliment the JavaScript code for creating the sticky navigation and also how to implement the interactive testimonial section of my website.

- [Colt Steele's Git And GitHub Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/git-and-github-bootcamp/) - As my project grew, maintaining a clean git history became vital. The interactive rebase chapter of the course was useful in helping me refactor prior commits, ensuring the long-term manageability of my project.

### Content

Some of the text content on the website was written by me, while some were generated by ChatGPT, which I then edited and refined. ChatGPT was also used to help check for any potential spelling or grammatical errors in the text.

### Media

- [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/saturn) - Where I sourced my favicon.
- [Thin Glyphs Icon Set](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1003754713433918928) - Many of the website SVG icons were sourced from this Figma Icon Set.
- [Retturoo: Hand Drawn Retro Shapes](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1163470945933586849) - A selection of shapes from this Figma collection was used for the website's decorative elements.
- [Brandfetch](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/733590967040604714/Brandfetch) - All of the Brand Logo SVGs were generated from this Figma plugin.
- [User Profile](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/749945157855564842/User-Profile) - This Figma plugin allowed me to generate profile avatars for each of the personas in the testimonial section.
- [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/) - All images were generated with the usage of Midjourney v5.2.
